# MYEQUITIES

## Personal Investment Tracker
MYEQUITIES is a user input based program. It tracks current stock, bond, and cryptocurrency holdings using weighted percentage-based pie charts and returns the portfolios current total value and distributions.
There are also features such as displaying information on historical prices for all shares held in the portfolio since the purchase date and sentiment analysis from major financial websites and popular subreddits on Reddit. 

The main idea behind this project was to learn about Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy python libraries, how to work with Jupyter notebooks and how to scrape data using python.

## How it works 
Run the py file, and you will be prompted to enter the ticker symbols for your current stock or bond holdings and the number of shares held for each particular holding. You will then be returned a weighted percentage based pie chart showing the distributions of the stocks or bonds in your portfolio. The prices displayed will be current up to date prices and are derived from the Yahoo Finance API.
